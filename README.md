I'm an amateur researcher just uploading my notes and hosting my [website](https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes) on GitHub. I also sometimes (very rarely) post issues. 

If you were so curious — which I highly doubt — you could also check out [the Notes Coalition](https://notes-coalition.github.io/), where others and I have created a kind of directory to our notes.

Finally, you could always contact me at Mspicata#9966.
